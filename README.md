# Introduction
Data modeling can be a useful tool for HR departments. With huge data sets including lots of details about all of the companies' employees, as well as historical data sets which are often required, data base management soon becomes an absolute necessity. This project uses historical data from a fictional company to create a working data model using SQL queries. The DBMS used is PostgreSQL, using PGAdmin. The tasks are categorized into:
* Data modeling: An initial schema for a relational data model was created using [QuickDBD](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com)
* Data engineering: A data base was created using the queries provided in the `.sql` files of this repository and populated using the corresponding `.csv` files.
* Data analysis: A series of analyses are performed using SQL language to return views in the data base. An additional analysis was done using Jupyter Notebook to evaluate the authenticity of the provided data sets.

# Data sets
The data sets correspond to historical HR data from a fictional company and can be found as `.csv` files in the `data` folder of this respository. These files were provided by the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey Data Analytics Bootcamp for the February - August 2020 term.

# Code explanation
To run this code, you will have to create a new data base using PGAdmin. Use the provided queries to create the corresponding tables and populate them with the `.csv` files.
